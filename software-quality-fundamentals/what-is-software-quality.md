# Defining quality
## Definitions in literature

- NBR/ISO 9000:2005: degree to which a set of inherent characteristics satisfies requirements

- Peters (2002): "Software quality is evaluated in terms of high-level attributes called factors, which are measured against low-level attributes called criteria."

- Sanders (1994): “A software product presents quality depending on the degree of satisfaction of customer needs in all aspects of the product.”

- Pressman: “Software quality is conformance to functional and performance requirements that have been explicitly stated, to clearly documented development standards, and to implicit characteristics that are expected of all professionally developed software.”

- ISO/IEC 25010:2011: “ability of the software product to satisfy stated and implied needs under specified conditions”

- IEEE Standard (2014): “the degree to which a software product meets established requirements; However quality depends on the degree to which these requirements accurately represent the needs, wants and expectations of stakeholders.”

### Important aspects

- Software requirements are the basis for measuring quality

- Specified standards define set of development criteria

- There are implicit requirements that are not mentioned that directly affect quality

| Quality perceptions | |
|---------------------|-|
| **Transcendental vision** | Quality is recognized through experience, but without definition or metrics. |
| **User view** | It is customized according to the user's needs. |
| **Manufacturing Vision** | Quality is related to compliance with requirements |
| **Product vision** | A product with good measurable internal properties will have good external quality. |
| **Value-based view** | It represents ‘cost-benefit’ in the customer’s view. |

## Quality norms and standards
### What are technical standards?

Documents published by professional organizations that aim to standardize certain activities, processes, products, etc…

### Important institutions

- IEEE: “Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers”
- ISO: “International Organization for Standardization
- IEC: “International Electrotechnical Commission”

### Software quality standards

| Family ISO 9000 | |
|-----------------|-|
| ISO 9000 | Describes the foundation of quality management systems and their terminologies |
| ISO 9001 | Specifies requirements for quality management system |
| ISO 9004 | Guidelines that consider effectiveness and efficiency of the quality management system |
| ISO 9126 | Software Product Quality Model |
| ISO/IEC 14598 | Software product evaluation process from the perspective of the developer, acquirer and evaluator |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 | Software lifecycle processes |
| ISO 19011 | Guidelines on auditing software quality management systems |
| IEEE 1012:2016 | Verification and validation for systems, software and hardware |
| IEEE 730:2014 | Requirements for planning, controlling and executing software quality assurance processes |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2019 | Focus on the information management process |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 29199:2013 | Vocabulary, process, documentation, models and techniques for testing |
| Family SQuaRE: ISO/IEC 25000-25099 (System and Software Quality Requeriments and Evolution) | Replaces ISO/IEC 9126 |

## Measuring quality

- Internal quality: totality of the software’s characteristics from an internal point of view

- Internal metrics: can be applied to a non-executable software product, such as specifications and source code. They serve to evaluate the quality of the product before the product becomes executable. They are also indicators of external attributes.

- External quality: totality of product characteristics from an external point of view, including requirements derived from user needs and quality requirements in use

- External metrics: use measurements of a software product derived from measurements of the system's behavior through testing, operation and observation of the product

- Quality in use: view of quality from the user's point of view, in a specific environment and context of use

- Quality in use metrics: measure how well a product meets specified user needs

### Looking at ISO/IEC 25010

## Software quality management process
### Software quality management

- Set of all processes that ensure that products, services and the life cycle meet quality objectives and achieve **user satisfaction**.

**Management activities**

- Quality planning
- Quality assurance
- Quality control
- Processes improvement

### Planning

- quality standards and processes to be used
- specific quality goals
- effort and organization of activities

### Quality assurance

- Activities that define and evaluate the suitability of software processes in order to provide evidence that establishes confidence in the product produced.

### Quality control

- Examination of project artifacts to determine whether agreed standards are being followed

- Evaluation of intermediate products and the final product

### Process improvements

- Is concerned with improvements in efficiency, effectiveness and any characteristics that have as their main goal the improvement of software quality

### Another perspective

1. Application of technical methods
2. Conducting formal technical reviews
3. Software testing activities
4. Applying standards
5. Change control
6. Measurement
7. Record keeping and reports
