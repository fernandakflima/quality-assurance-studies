# Test Automation Fundamentals

Introduce important concepts related to test automation, understanding its purpose and the essential factors for the success of its implementation along with the software life cycle.

## Automation as a testing activity

**Testware design process:**

- Software
- Documentation
- Test environments
- Test data

**Related testing activities:**

- Implementation of automated test cases
- Monitoring and control of execution
- Interpretation, reporting and log of results

## Automation objectives

- Improve testing efficiency
- Expand test coverage
- Reduce total testing cost
- Decrease execution time
- Increase testing frequency

## Advantages of automation

- Tests that cannot be done manually
- Complexity can increase and time decreases
- Reduces human errors in evaluation
- Faster feedback
- Greater reliability

## Disadvantages of automation

- Additional costs
- Initial investment to configure the test architecture
- Investment in the architecture of the software under test
- Coding complexity
- Test maintenance

# Success factors for automation

**Some reflections**

- Not all tests can or should be automated
- Test automation does not replace manual testing
- Automation is limited by system analysis. The subjectivity of the analyst/engineer is important
- Automated test script is also code just like any other software, therefore, a good analyst must focus on clean code and good practices

## Automation Project Architecture

- The architecture of an automation project must be aligned with the architecture of the software product.
- Remember that there are non-functional requirements for testing.
- Involvement with project developers is essential for the success of automation.

## Testability

- The software product must be built and modeled with support for automated tests in mind.
     - Decoupling between layers
     - Expose modules/functions/classes to facilitate testing
- Identifying and analyzing modules that are testable is part of the automation decision process.

## Testing strategies

- Identify the set, types and levels of automated tests that ensure system consistency and coverage

### Use of Test Automation Framework

**Evaluating a good framework guarantees benefits for:**

- Implement test reports
- Facilitate problem solving
- Facilitate environment configuration
- Document test cases
- Track test case steps
- Facilitate test maintenance
- Update of automated tests
- Monitor and restore test execution in case of failure
