# Software quality in the world of engineering

- Software Engineering (Present throughout the entire software production cycle)
    - Viable solutions
    - Technical processes
    - Management processes
- Software process (Specification, development, validation and evolution)

## Software Engineering X QA

- Software engineering is different from coding

- Basic types of software engineers:
    - Front-End: Visual part of the application and interaction with the user
    - Back-End: Data processing, business rules
    - Quality Assurance: Validations and functionality checks, defect management and quality processes
    - DevOps/SRE (Site Reliability Engineering): Culture and operations processes to ensure reliability, monitoring, performance and development pipelines

## Profiles and responsibilities of a QA
