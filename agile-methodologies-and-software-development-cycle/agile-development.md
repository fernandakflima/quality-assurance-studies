# Agile development

## The agile manifesto
### What does the manifesto say?

>We are discovering better ways to develop software, making it ourselves and helping others do the same. Through this work, we come to value:
>
>**Individuals and interactions** more than processes and tools
>**Working software** more than comprehensive documentation
>**Customer collaboration** more than contract negotiation
>**Respond to changes** more than following a plan
>
> In other words, even though there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### The 12 principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through continuous and early delivery of value-added software.

2. Changes to requirements are welcome, even late in the development. Agile processes take advantage of changes to competitive for the customer.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a few weeks to a few months, with preference to the shortest time scale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily for the entire project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and the support needed and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of transmitting information to and between a team development is through face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users must be able to maintain a steady pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design increases agility.

10. Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of undone work – is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from teams self-organizing.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective and then refines and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### What does it mean to be agile?

- Prescriptive methods do not are no longer useful, however there is a point that can make it flawed: the weaknesses and failures of those who develop the software!

- Agility drivers: adaptation, communication, self-organization

- Adaptation helps to reduce of costs for changes

### Motivations

- Difficult to predict software requirements and their possible changes
- Difficult to predict customer prioritization
- Analysis, design and testing are not predictable
- Software construction activities are not easily estimated

## Extreme Programming - XP
### ‘Extreme Programming’ emergence

- Early work and associated methods: 1980
- Original work by Kent Beck
- There is a variant with refinements for large organizations: IXP - Industrial Extreme Programming

### The process

- Focus paradigm: orientation to objects

- Involves constant rules and practices during software process

**Planning**

- Focus on communication, on ‘listening’ to from planning poker.
- The activity leads to the creation of stories of the user by the customer, who also prioritizes them.
- Members estimate based on weeks of development. Ideal maximum of 3 weeks
- Flexibility for writing new stories
- Customers and developers work side by side = basic commitment
- Speed: number of stories delivered

**Project**

- KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid!)
- Encouragement in the use of cards CRC
- Point solution from prototypes

**Codification**

- Use of TDD (Test Driven development)
- Refactoring: improvement of code
- Pair programming

**Tests**

- Use of TDD (Test Driven development)
- Continuous integration
- Inclusion of acceptance tests

**Values**

- Communication
- Simplicity
- Respect
- Courage
- Feedback

## Scrum

Name comes from an action in a rugby match: players from both
teams come together with their heads down and push each other to get
ball possession

### Emergence and theory

- Created by Jeff Sutherland in the early 1990s and has been growing ever since being reviewed
- “Lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions to complex problems.”
- Based on empiricism and lean thinking
- Iterative and incremental
- Formal events for inspection and adaptation

### Scrum Team

- Small team of people without hierarchy
    - Scrum master
    - Product owner
    - Developers
- They are multifunctional and self-managing
- Responsible for all activities related to the product

#### Scrum Master

- Scrum Guardian
- Leadership that serves the organization
    Responsibilities:
    - Train members for self-management
    - Team concentration
    - Removal of impediments
    - Event maintenance
    - Assists PO with techniques and improvements in Backlog management

#### Product Owner

- Maximizes product value
- Product Backlog Management:
    - Develop and express product goal
    - Create and communicate Backlog items
    - Sort items
    - Ensure that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understandable

#### Developers

- Creation of usable increment each sprint
- Broad skills according to the work domain
- Responsibilities:
    - Create Sprint Backlog
    - Align the Ready setting
    - Adaptation towards the Sprint goal
    - Take responsibility as professionals

### Events
#### Sprint

- Fixed duration events with the objective of generating increment
- Activities = Sprint Planning + Daily + Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective
- No changes are made that put the Sprint goal at risk
- Focus on quality
- Refinement as needed
- Only PO can cancel the Sprint

#### Planning

- Starts sprint: definition of the work to be done
- Why is this sprint valuable?
- What can be done in this Sprint?
- How will the work be carried out?
- Creation of the Sprint Backlog

#### Daily

- Inspection towards the sprint goal
- Adaptation of the Sprint Backlog
- Short term/daily
- Work plan
- Communication
- Impediment removal

#### Sprint review

- Present and inspect results
- Determine adaptations
- Adjustment of the Product Backlog
- Scrum Team + Stakeholders
- Penultimate sprint event

#### Sprint retrospective

-  Planning focused on quality and effectiveness
- Inspection of processes, interactions, tools…
- What worked?
- What didn't work?
- How was it resolved?
- Sprint completion

### Artifacts

- Product Backlog -> Product Goal
- Sprint Backlog -> Sprint Goal
- Increment -> Definition of ready

## Other agile models

Systems Development Method
Dynamic (DSDM)

- Focus on building and maintaining systems that satisfy operating constraints short term through prototyping in a controlled environment
- Analogy with Pareto Principle: 80% of an application can be delivered in 20% of the time it would take to deliver the complete application It is iterative and incremental
- Only enough work is required for each increment
- Can be combined with XP

**Principles**

- Focus on business needs
- Deliver on time
-  Collaborate
- Never compromise on quality
- Build incrementally from solid foundations
- Develop iteratively
- Communicate continuously and clearly
- Demonstrate control.

**Phases**

- Pre-project: Budget, contract and project candidates
- Life cycle: Product development
- Feasibility analysis
- Functional model iteration
- Design and construction iteration
- Implementation
- Post-project: Maintenance, improvements and adjustments

**Roles**

- Executive manager
- Visionary
- Intermediary
- Advertiser
- Project manager
- Technical coordinator
- Team leader
- Developer
- Tester
- Clerk
- Facilitator

### Agile Unified Process

- Philosophy: Sequential for what is broad and iterative for what is particular

**Activities**

- Modeling
- Implementation
- Tests
- Delivery
- Configuration and management
- Environment management

### Kanban

- Means card/signage -> Japan
- Methodology for organizing tasks
    - To do
    - Doing
    - Done
- It is simple and should be combined with other frameworks for managing the
project
