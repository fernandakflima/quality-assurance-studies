# The agile manifesto
## What does the manifesto say?

>We are discovering better ways to develop software, making it ourselves and helping others do the same. Through this work, we come to value:
>
>**Individuals and interactions** more than processes and tools
>
>**Working software** more than comprehensive documentation
>
>**Customer collaboration** more than contract negotiation
>
>**Respond to changes** more than following a plan
>
> In other words, even though there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## The 12 principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through continuous and early delivery of value-added software.
2. Changes to requirements are welcome, even late in the development. Agile processes take advantage of changes to competitive for the customer.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a few weeks to a few months, with preference to the shortest time scale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily for the entire project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and the support needed and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of transmitting information to and between a team development is through face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users must be able to maintain a steady pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design increases agility.
10. Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of undone work – is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from teams self-organizing.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective and then refines and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## What does it mean to be agile?

- Prescriptive methods do not are no longer useful, however there is a point that can make it flawed: the weaknesses and failures of those who develop the software!

- Agility drivers: adaptation, communication, self-organization
- Adaptation helps to reduce of costs for changes

## Motivations

- Difficult to predict software requirements and their possible changes
- Difficult to predict customer prioritization
- Analysis, design and testing are not predictable
- Software construction activities are not easily estimated
