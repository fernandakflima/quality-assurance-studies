# ‘Extreme Programming’ emergence

- Early work and associated methods: 1980
- Original work by Kent Beck
- There is a variant with refinements for large organizations: IXP - Industrial Extreme Programming

## The process

- Focus paradigm: orientation to objects
- Involves constant rules and practices during software process

**Planning**

- Focus on communication, on ‘listening’ to from planning poker.
- The activity leads to the creation of stories of the user by the customer, who also prioritizes them.
- Members estimate based on weeks of development. Ideal maximum of 3 weeks
- Flexibility for writing new stories
- Customers and developers work side by side = basic commitment
- Speed: number of stories delivered

**Project**

- KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid!)
- Encouragement in the use of cards CRC
- Point solution from prototypes

**Codification**

- Use of TDD (Test Driven development)
- Refactoring: improvement of code
- Pair programming

**Tests**

- Use of TDD (Test Driven development)
- Continuous integration
- Inclusion of acceptance tests

**Values**

- Communication
- Simplicity
- Respect
- Courage
- Feedback

# Scrum

Name comes from an action in a rugby match: players from both
teams come together with their heads down and push each other to get
ball possession

## Emergence and theory

- Created by Jeff Sutherland in the early 1990s and has been growing ever since being reviewed
- “Lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions to complex problems.”
- Based on empiricism and lean thinking
- Iterative and incremental
- Formal events for inspection and adaptation

## Scrum Team

- Small team of people without hierarchy
    - Scrum master
    - Product owner
    - Developers
- They are multifunctional and self-managing
- Responsible for all activities related to the product

### Scrum Master

- Scrum Guardian
- Leadership that serves the organization
    Responsibilities:
    - Train members for self-management
    - Team concentration
    - Removal of impediments
    - Event maintenance
    - Assists PO with techniques and improvements in Backlog management

### Product Owner

- Maximizes product value
- Product Backlog Management:
    - Develop and express product goal
    - Create and communicate Backlog items
    - Sort items
    - Ensure that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understandable

### Developers

- Creation of usable increment each sprint
- Broad skills according to the work domain
- Responsibilities:
    - Create Sprint Backlog
    - Align the Ready setting
    - Adaptation towards the Sprint goal
    - Take responsibility as professionals

## Events
### Sprint

- Fixed duration events with the objective of generating increment
- Activities = Sprint Planning + Daily + Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective
- No changes are made that put the Sprint goal at risk
- Focus on quality
- Refinement as needed
- Only PO can cancel the Sprint

### Planning

- Starts sprint: definition of the work to be done
- Why is this sprint valuable?
- What can be done in this Sprint?
- How will the work be carried out?
- Creation of the Sprint Backlog

### Daily

- Inspection towards the sprint goal
- Adaptation of the Sprint Backlog
- Short term/daily
- Work plan
- Communication
- Impediment removal

### Sprint review

- Present and inspect results
- Determine adaptations
- Adjustment of the Product Backlog
- Scrum Team + Stakeholders
- Penultimate sprint event

### Sprint retrospective

-  Planning focused on quality and effectiveness
- Inspection of processes, interactions, tools…
- What worked?
- What didn't work?
- How was it resolved?
- Sprint completion

## Artifacts

- Product Backlog -> Product Goal
- Sprint Backlog -> Sprint Goal
- Increment -> Definition of ready

# Other agile models

Systems Development Method
Dynamic (DSDM)

- Focus on building and maintaining systems that satisfy operating constraints short term through prototyping in a controlled environment
- Analogy with Pareto Principle: 80% of an application can be delivered in 20% of the time it would take to deliver the complete application It is iterative and incremental
- Only enough work is required for each increment
- Can be combined with XP

**Principles**

- Focus on business needs
- Deliver on time
-  Collaborate
- Never compromise on quality
- Build incrementally from solid foundations
- Develop iteratively
- Communicate continuously and clearly
- Demonstrate control.

**Phases**

- Pre-project: Budget, contract and project candidates
- Life cycle: Product development
- Feasibility analysis
- Functional model iteration
- Design and construction iteration
- Implementation
- Post-project: Maintenance, improvements and adjustments

**Roles**

- Executive manager
- Visionary
- Intermediary
- Advertiser
- Project manager
- Technical coordinator
- Team leader
- Developer
- Tester
- Clerk
- Facilitator

## Agile Unified Process

- Philosophy: Sequential for what is broad and iterative for what is particular

**Activities**

- Modeling
- Implementation
- Tests
- Delivery
- Configuration and management
- Environment management

## Kanban

- Means card/signage -> Japan
- Methodology for organizing tasks
    - To do
    - Doing
    - Done
- It is simple and should be combined with other frameworks for managing the
project
