# Testing in the Agile World

### Contextualizing the testing activity
#### The adoption of testing in software life cycles

- For each development activity there is a testing activity
- Each test level has specific objectives
- Test analysis and modeling begins during development activity
- Participation in the requirements process, modeling, refinement...

#### QAâ€™s participation in the user story

- User stories - functional and non-functional requirements
- 3C Concept
  - Card
  - Conversation
  - Confirmation - acceptance criteria
- Perspective of the tester differs from that of the client, the PO and the developer

#### Activities involved in planning

- Detailed analysis of stories
- Determine testability of the story
- Create acceptance tests
- Create tasks for testing
- Estimate effort
- Identify functional and non-functional aspects to be evaluated
- Participate in the automation process

#### Detailing the testing approach

- Determine scope, extent, objectives and reasons for testing
- Members who will act
- Necessary data environment
- Time, dependency and prerequisites
- Risks involved

### Tests in agile approaches
#### Differences in approaches and tests

- Testing activities are always related to development, therefore, it is important to know the different processes and life cycles and how testing and quality activities fit together!
- Each company adopts a process and customizes it according to needs
- Adaptation is the keyword
- Quality and testing activities are embedded in each iteration, and parallelism and overlap with other activities may occur
- Each person on the team has a direct role in validation and verification
- Focus on security, performance and exploratory testing
- Use of automation for regression testing
- Sufficient documentation for maintenance and quality assurance

#### Common work products

- Automated tests - results
- Test plans
- Risk analysis
- Evidence of manual testing
- Defect reports

#### Test levels in the agile model

- They are superimposed
- Focus
  - Unit testing
  - Acceptance test
    - Verification
    - Validation
- Use of continuous integration and delivery and test automation

#### Testing status in the agile model

- Adaptation of the model, there is evolution and critical analysis to define what is effectively completed
- Frequent updating of manual and automated tests
- Monitors status of all team activities - focus on feedback
- Daily meetings for communication

#### Attitudes and skills for agility

- Poaitivity and thinking about the solution with everyone on the team
- Critical thinking with a focus on quality
- Constant communication with the client
- Constant feedback
- Evaluation of scenarios that represent the acceptance criteria
- Adaptation to change
- Organization and planning

#### Other activities in the agile team

- Understand and update testing strategies
- Measure and report test coverage
- Ensure proper use of tools
- Manage test environment and its data
- Report defects and manage them
- Ensure tasks appropriately and their estimates
- Continuous clarification of requirements with the team
- Suggesting improvements

### Testing methods in the agile model

- TDD - Test Driven Development
- ATDD - Acceptance test-driven development
- BDD - Behavior-driven development

#### Useful practices for testing

- Assisted test
- Incremental testing
- Mental map
