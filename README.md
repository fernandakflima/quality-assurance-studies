## Quality Assurance

In this repository, I cover theoretical issues about the career and day-to-day life of a Quality Assurance professional.

I cover subjects such as agile methodologies, software development cycles, the fundamentals of software quality, which are basic concepts.

I also talk about the CTFL certification, and the fundamentals of test automation, which are more intermediate subjects.

I also made research sources and some more links available.
